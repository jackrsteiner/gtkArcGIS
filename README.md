Resource files for Getting to Know ArcGIS 4th Ed. by esriPress. These are starter files for completing the in book exercises.

## Purpose
At one time these files were included on CD with the book but are now only provided for download. Unfortunately, the files provided by esriPress online are incorrect -- they seem to be at least partially from the 3rd edition. http://esripress.esri.com/bookResources/index.cfm?event=catalog.book&id=16

## Acknowledgment
These files are being provided for the good of the general public but are not my own. They were downloaded from an esriPress box.com account. I do not know the license and will remove them if asked.
